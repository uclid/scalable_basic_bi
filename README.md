# SCALABLE BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE FOR MEDIUM SCALE ENTERPRISES

## Undergraduate Research/Capstone Project

Business Intelligence is a popular concept in global market today. Many large
enterprises frequently use a number of products that help in business analysis and
decision making. However, such systems prove really costly for medium scale
enterprises. One of the main reasons for this is that the enterprises have to pay for the
tools whose many features are either unnecessary or never used. Those enterprises
have the potential to grow and need good decision support for that, but affordability
comes as an important issue. Due to this, the current practices are mostly limited to
analysis of manually created charts in meetings and boardroom discussions.

This project explores the tools and techniques that can be used to build Business
Intelligence system for such enterprises which is both inexpensive and scalable when
the enterprise grows. With simple data analysis methods and integration of various
low cost components, a stable and powerful system can be created. Hence, the project
discusses different statistical techniques, and free and open-source platforms which
can be used to develop a secure, interactive and sustainable Business Intelligence
system that enables data visualization and predictive analysis.
